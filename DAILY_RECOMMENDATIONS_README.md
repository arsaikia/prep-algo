# 🎯 Daily Practice Recommendation System

## Overview

The **Daily Practice Recommendation System** is an intelligent algorithm that analyzes user solve history to provide personalized coding question recommendations. It uses multiple strategies to optimize learning efficiency and ensure comprehensive skill development.

## 🧠 How It Works

### High-Level Architecture

The recommendation system follows a cyclical learning approach where user interactions continuously improve future recommendations:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["👤 User Solves Question"] --> B["📊 Update Solve History"]
    B --> C["🔍 Analyze User Patterns"]
    
    C --> D["📈 User Level Classification"]
    C --> E["🎯 Identify Weak Areas"] 
    C --> F["💪 Find Strong Areas"]
    C --> G["🔄 Detect Struggling Questions"]
    
    D --> H{"User Level?"}
    H -->|"< 20 solved OR < 40% Medium"| I["🟢 Beginner"]
    H -->|"20-50 solved AND 40%+ Medium"| J["🟡 Intermediate"] 
    H -->|"50+ solved AND 20%+ Hard"| K["🔴 Advanced"]
    
    E --> L["📋 Generate Recommendations"]
    F --> L
    G --> L
    I --> L
    J --> L
    K --> L
    
    L --> M["Strategy 1: 💪 Weak Area Reinforcement<br/>40% of recommendations<br/>Priority: HIGH"]
    L --> N["Strategy 2: 📈 Progressive Difficulty<br/>30% of recommendations<br/>Priority: MEDIUM"]
    L --> O["Strategy 3: 🔄 Spaced Repetition<br/>20% of recommendations<br/>Priority: HIGH"]
    L --> P["Strategy 4: 🗺️ Topic Exploration<br/>Remaining slots<br/>Priority: LOW"]
    L --> Q["Strategy 5: ⭐ General Practice<br/>Fill any remaining<br/>Priority: MEDIUM"]
    
    M --> R["🎯 Final Recommendations"]
    N --> R
    O --> R
    P --> R
    Q --> R
    
    R --> S["📱 Display to User"]
    S --> T["✅ User Selects & Solves"]
    T --> A
```

### Strategy Distribution

The system allocates recommendations across five strategies with the following distribution:

```mermaid
pie title Recommendation Strategy Distribution
    "💪 Weak Area Reinforcement" : 40
    "📈 Progressive Difficulty" : 30
    "🔄 Spaced Repetition" : 20
    "🗺️ Topic Exploration" : 7
    "⭐ General Practice" : 3
```

### User Analysis Engine

The system automatically analyzes user patterns to create a personalized learning profile:

- **📊 Skill Level Detection**: Automatically categorizes users as Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced
- **🎯 Topic Strength Analysis**: Identifies strong and weak algorithm categories
- **�� Difficulty Progression**: Tracks comfort level across Easy/Medium/Hard problems
- **⏰ Activity Patterns**: Monitors recent practice frequency and consistency
- **🔄 Struggle Detection**: Identifies questions requiring multiple attempts

### Recommendation Strategies

The system uses a balanced multi-strategy approach:

| Strategy | Weight | Purpose | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|---------|
| **💪 Weak Area Reinforcement** | 40% | Strengthen topics with low solve count or high retry rate | User struggles with Dynamic Programming → Recommend DP problems |
| **📈 Progressive Difficulty** | 30% | Gradually increase challenge level | Beginner with 70% Easy problems → Suggest Medium problems |
| **🔄 Spaced Repetition** | 20% | Review previously challenging questions | Question solved 3+ times recently → Schedule for review |
| **🗺️ Topic Exploration** | Remaining | Introduce new algorithm categories | User hasn't tried Graph problems → Suggest easy Graph questions |
| **⭐ General Practice** | Fill remaining | Quality questions for comprehensive practice | High-quality TOP 150 questions matching user level |

### Priority System

Recommendations are prioritized to maximize learning impact:

- **🔴 High Priority**: Weak areas, spaced repetition items
- **🟡 Medium Priority**: Progressive difficulty, general practice
- **🔵 Low Priority**: Topic exploration

## 🚀 Implementation

### Backend API

#### Endpoint
```http
GET /api/v1/solveHistory/:userId/daily-recommendations?count=5
```

#### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "recommendations": [
      {
        "question": {
          "_id": "question-id",
          "name": "Two Sum",
          "group": "Arrays & Hashing",

## 📊 Data Models

### Enhanced SolveHistory Schema

```javascript
{
  userId: String,           // User identifier
  questionId: String,       // Question identifier
  solveCount: Number,       // Total times solved
  lastUpdatedAt: Date,      // Most recent solve date
  firstSolvedAt: Date,      // Initial solve date
  averageTimeToSolve: Number, // Average time in minutes
  difficulty_rating: Number,  // User's personal rating (1-5)
  tags: [String],           // User-defined tags
  solveHistory: [{          // Detailed solve sessions
    solvedAt: Date,
    timeSpent: Number,
    success: Boolean
  }]
}
```

router.route('/:userId/daily-recommendations').get(getDailyRecommendations);
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

Install the component in your React app:

```bash
# Copy the DailyRecommendations component to your project
cp -r frontend/src/components/DailyRecommendations your-project/src/components/
```

Import and use:

```jsx
import DailyRecommendations from './components/DailyRecommendations/DailyRecommendations';

function App() {
  const handleQuestionSelect = (question) => {
    // Navigate to question or open modal
    console.log('Selected question:', question);
  };

  return (
    <DailyRecommendations 
      userId="user123" 
      onQuestionSelect={handleQuestionSelect}
    />
  );
}
```

## 📈 Algorithm Details

### Detailed Algorithm Flow

The recommendation engine processes user data through multiple analysis stages:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "📊 User Analysis Engine"
        A1["📈 Solve History Data"] --> B1["🔢 Calculate Statistics"]
        B1 --> C1["Group Stats<br/>• Count per topic<br/>• Avg solve attempts<br/>• Success rates"]
        B1 --> C2["Difficulty Stats<br/>• Easy: X problems<br/>• Medium: Y problems<br/>• Hard: Z problems"]
        B1 --> C3["Activity Patterns<br/>• Recent activity<br/>• Solve frequency<br/>• Time patterns"]
        
        C1 --> D1["🎯 Weak Areas<br/>< 3 solved OR<br/>> 2 avg attempts"]
        C1 --> D2["💪 Strong Areas<br/>≥ 5 solved AND<br/>≤ 1.5 avg attempts"]
        C3 --> D3["🔄 Struggling Questions<br/>Solved 2+ times<br/>in last month"]

        E1 -->|"< 20 total OR < 40% Medium"| F1["🟢 Beginner"]
        E1 -->|"20-50 total AND 40%+ Medium"| F2["🟡 Intermediate"]
        E1 -->|"50+ total AND 20%+ Hard"| F3["🔴 Advanced"]
    end
    
    subgraph "🎯 Strategy Engine"
        G1["💪 Weak Area Reinforcement<br/>Math.ceil(count × 0.4)"]
        G2["📈 Progressive Difficulty<br/>Math.ceil(count × 0.3)"]
        G3["🔄 Spaced Repetition<br/>Math.ceil(count × 0.2)"]
        G4["🗺️ Topic Exploration<br/>Remaining slots"]
        G5["⭐ General Practice<br/>Fill any gaps"]
    end

        I3["🔵 LOW: Topic exploration"]
        I4["📋 Final Recommendations<br/>Sorted by priority<br/>Limited to requested count"]
    end

    H4 --> I3
    H5 --> I2
    
    I1 --> I4
    I2 --> I4
    I3 --> I4
```

### Weak Area Detection
```javascript
// Areas with < 3 solved questions OR average solve count > 2
const weakAreas = Object.entries(groupStats)
  .filter(([group, stats]) => stats.count < 3 || stats.avgSolveCount > 2)
  .map(([group]) => group);
```

### Progressive Difficulty Logic
```javascript
// Advance difficulty when user shows mastery
if (userLevel === 'beginner' && easyPercentage > 70) {
  return 'Medium'; // Suggest Medium problems
} else if (userLevel === 'intermediate' && mediumPercentage > 60) {
  return 'Hard'; // Suggest Hard problems
}
```

### Spaced Repetition
```javascript
// Questions solved 2+ times in the last month
const strugglingQuestions = userHistory.filter(h => 
  h.solveCount > 2 && h.lastUpdatedAt >= oneMonthAgo
);
```

### Topic Exploration & General Practice
```javascript
// Strategy 4: Explore new topics (remaining slots after first 3 strategies)
const unexploredGroups = allGroups.filter(group =>
  !analysis.groupStats[group] || analysis.groupStats[group].count < 2
);

// Strategy 5: Fill remaining slots with quality questions
const fillerQuestions = await Question.find({
  _id: { $nin: solvedQuestionIds },
  list: { $in: ['TOP 150'] },
  difficulty: getDifficultyForLevel(analysis.userLevel)
});
```
