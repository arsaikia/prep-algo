# 🎯 Daily Practice Recommendation System

## Overview

The **Daily Practice Recommendation System** is an intelligent algorithm that analyzes user solve history to provide personalized coding question recommendations. It uses multiple strategies to optimize learning efficiency and ensure comprehensive skill development.

## 🧠 How It Works

### User Analysis Engine

The system automatically analyzes user patterns to create a personalized learning profile:

- **📊 Skill Level Detection**: Automatically categorizes users as Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced
- **🎯 Topic Strength Analysis**: Identifies strong and weak algorithm categories
- **�� Difficulty Progression**: Tracks comfort level across Easy/Medium/Hard problems
- **⏰ Activity Patterns**: Monitors recent practice frequency and consistency
- **🔄 Struggle Detection**: Identifies questions requiring multiple attempts

### Recommendation Strategies

The system uses a balanced multi-strategy approach:

| Strategy | Weight | Purpose | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|---------|
| **💪 Weak Area Reinforcement** | 40% | Strengthen topics with low solve count or high retry rate | User struggles with Dynamic Programming → Recommend DP problems |
| **📈 Progressive Difficulty** | 30% | Gradually increase challenge level | Beginner with 70% Easy problems → Suggest Medium problems |
| **🔄 Spaced Repetition** | 20% | Review previously challenging questions | Question solved 3+ times recently → Schedule for review |
| **🗺️ Topic Exploration** | 10% | Introduce new algorithm categories | User hasn't tried Graph problems → Suggest easy Graph questions |

### Priority System

Recommendations are prioritized to maximize learning impact:

- **🔴 High Priority**: Weak areas, spaced repetition items
- **🟡 Medium Priority**: Progressive difficulty, general practice
- **🔵 Low Priority**: Topic exploration, discovery learning

## 🚀 Implementation

### Backend API

#### Endpoint
```http
GET /api/v1/solveHistory/:userId/daily-recommendations?count=5
```

#### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "recommendations": [
      {
        "question": {
          "_id": "question-id",
          "name": "Two Sum",
          "group": "Arrays & Hashing",
          "difficulty": "Easy"
        },
        "reason": "Strengthen weak area: Arrays & Hashing",
        "priority": "high",
        "strategy": "weak_area_reinforcement"
      }
    ],
    "analysis": {
      "userLevel": "intermediate",
      "totalSolved": 45,
      "weakAreas": ["Dynamic Programming", "Graphs"],
      "strongAreas": ["Arrays & Hashing"],
      "recentActivity": 3
    }
  }
}
```

## 📊 Data Models

### Enhanced SolveHistory Schema

```javascript
{
  userId: String,           // User identifier
  questionId: String,       // Question identifier
  solveCount: Number,       // Total times solved
  lastUpdatedAt: Date,      // Most recent solve date
  firstSolvedAt: Date,      // Initial solve date
  averageTimeToSolve: Number, // Average time in minutes
  difficulty_rating: Number,  // User's personal rating (1-5)
  tags: [String],           // User-defined tags
  solveHistory: [{          // Detailed solve sessions
    solvedAt: Date,
    timeSpent: Number,
    success: Boolean
  }]
}
```

### User Level Classification

| Level | Criteria | Recommended Difficulty |
|-------|----------|----------------------|
| **Beginner** | < 20 total solved OR < 40% Medium | Easy questions |
| **Intermediate** | 20-50 solved AND 40%+ Medium | Easy + Medium |
| **Advanced** | 50+ solved AND 20%+ Hard | Medium + Hard |

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup

Add the recommendation route to your Express server:

```javascript
// routes/solveHistory.js
import { getDailyRecommendations } from '../controller/solveHistory.js';

router.route('/:userId/daily-recommendations').get(getDailyRecommendations);
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

Install the component in your React app:

```bash
# Copy the DailyRecommendations component to your project
cp -r frontend/src/components/DailyRecommendations your-project/src/components/
```

Import and use:

```jsx
import DailyRecommendations from './components/DailyRecommendations/DailyRecommendations';

function App() {
  const handleQuestionSelect = (question) => {
    // Navigate to question or open modal
    console.log('Selected question:', question);
  };

  return (
    <DailyRecommendations 
      userId="user123" 
      onQuestionSelect={handleQuestionSelect}
    />
  );
}
```

## 📈 Algorithm Details

### Weak Area Detection
```javascript
// Areas with < 3 solved questions OR average solve count > 2
const weakAreas = Object.entries(groupStats)
  .filter(([group, stats]) => stats.count < 3 || stats.avgSolveCount > 2)
  .map(([group]) => group);
```

### Progressive Difficulty Logic
```javascript
// Advance difficulty when user shows mastery
if (userLevel === 'beginner' && easyPercentage > 70) {
  return 'Medium'; // Suggest Medium problems
} else if (userLevel === 'intermediate' && mediumPercentage > 60) {
  return 'Hard'; // Suggest Hard problems
}
```

### Spaced Repetition
```javascript
// Questions solved 2+ times in the last month
const strugglingQuestions = userHistory.filter(h => 
  h.solveCount > 2 && h.lastUpdatedAt >= oneMonthAgo
);
```
