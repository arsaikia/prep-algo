# Unified Smart Recommendation System

## 🎯 Overview

The RemindMe platform features a sophisticated, unified recommendation system that provides personalized daily coding practice recommendations based on user learning patterns, progress tracking, and adaptive difficulty adjustment.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### **Single Unified Endpoint**
```
/api/v1/recommendations/{userId}/daily
```

This endpoint replaces all previous recommendation systems and provides:
- Dynamic learning analytics
- Personalized question recommendations  
- Real-time progress tracking
- Adaptive user classification

## 📊 Core Components

### 1. **Dynamic Learning Analytics**

#### **Streak Calculation**
```javascript
// Real-time streak tracking
const streakInfo = {
    currentStreak: 7,        // Consecutive days from today backwards
    longestStreak: 12,       // Historical best streak
    lastActivityDate: "2024-01-15",
    totalActiveDays: 45      // Total days with activity
};
```

#### **Topic Mastery Progression**
```javascript
// 5-level mastery system
const masteryLevels = {
    "mastered":   "🏆 80%+ coverage + 90%+ solve rate + ≤2.5 avg attempts",
    "proficient": "⭐ 60%+ coverage + 85%+ solve rate + ≤3.0 avg attempts", 
    "practicing": "📈 40%+ coverage + 75%+ solve rate",
    "learning":   "📚 15%+ coverage OR 3+ questions attempted",
    "beginner":   "🌱 < 15% coverage AND < 3 questions attempted"
};
```

### 2. **Adaptive User Classification**

The system uses **both breadth and depth** for accurate skill assessment:

#### **Advanced Users** (🔥)
```javascript
// Requires significant breadth (40%+ topics) AND depth
const advancedCriteria = {
    totalSolved: "≥ 60 questions",
    topicBreadth: "≥ 40% of available topics",
    depth: [
        "25%+ mastery rate with 50%+ proficient+mastered",
        "OR 2+ mastered + 3+ proficient topics",
        "OR 15%+ hard problems + 2+ mastered topics"
    ]
};
```

#### **Intermediate Users** (⚡)
```javascript
// Some breadth (25%+ topics) with demonstrated competency
const intermediateCriteria = {
    totalSolved: "≥ 25 questions", 
    topicBreadth: "≥ 25% of available topics",
    competency: [
        "1+ mastered + 3+ proficient/practicing topics",
        "OR 35%+ medium performance across 30%+ topics",
        "OR 8%+ hard problems across 20%+ topics"
    ]
};
```

#### **Beginner Users** (🌱)
```javascript
const beginnerCriteria = {
    fallback: "< 25 questions OR < 25% topic breadth OR no mastery"
};
```

### 3. **Dynamic Scaling System**

#### **Database-Driven Topic Counts**
```javascript
// No hardcoded values - automatically adapts to new content
const getTopicQuestionCounts = async () => {
    const topicCounts = await Question.aggregate([
        { $group: { _id: '$group', totalQuestions: { $sum: 1 } } }
    ]);
    return countMap; // Dynamic topic distribution
};
```

#### **Percentage-Based Calculations**
```javascript
// Scales automatically with content growth
const topicCoveragePercentage = (userQuestions / totalAvailableQuestions) * 100;
const topicBreadthPercentage = (topicsAttempted / totalAvailableTopics) * 100;
```

## 🎯 Recommendation Strategies

### **1. Weak Area Reinforcement** (40% weight)
- Identifies topics with < 3 questions solved OR > 2 average attempts
- Prioritizes high-impact improvement areas
- Uses appropriate difficulty for user level

### **2. Progressive Difficulty** (30% weight)  
- Gradually increases challenge based on user performance
- Adapts difficulty distribution to user classification
- Maintains optimal learning curve

### **3. Spaced Repetition** (20% weight)
- Revisits previously solved questions after optimal intervals
- Strengthens long-term retention
- Focuses on questions with multiple attempts

### **4. Topic Exploration** (10% weight)
- Introduces new topics for breadth expansion
- Encourages well-rounded skill development
- Balances depth with exploration

## 📈 Analytics Dashboard

  "analysis": {
    "userLevel": "advanced",
    "totalSolved": 85,
    "streakInfo": {
      "currentStreak": 7,
      "longestStreak": 12,
      "totalActiveDays": 45

## 🔄 Smart Caching System

### **Intelligent Batch Management**
```javascript
// Efficient recommendation caching with selective refresh
const batchTypes = {
    "fresh":            "New daily batch with full analysis",
    "smart_refresh":    "Updated analysis with fresh recommendations", 
    "selective_refresh": "Replace only completed questions",
    "cached":           "Serve existing valid batch"
};
```

### **Refresh Strategies**
- **Time-based**: Automatic refresh after 24 hours
- **Completion-based**: Refresh when 80%+ questions completed
- **Manual**: Force refresh on user request
- **Selective**: Replace only completed questions
