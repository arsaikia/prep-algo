# 🎯 Smart Recommendation System - Hybrid Refresh Strategy

## 📋 **Overview**

We've implemented a **Hybrid Refresh Strategy** that balances user experience with smart recommendation updates. The system maintains stable daily batches while providing intelligent refresh options.

## 🔄 **New Refresh Logic**

### **Core Principles:**
1. **Stable Daily Batch** - Questions remain consistent during the same day
2. **Smart Next-Day Refresh** - Auto-refresh only when user makes progress and it's a new day
3. **Manual Control** - Users can get fresh questions for completed ones
4. **Completed Questions Reference** - Solved questions stay visible at bottom

### **Refresh Conditions:**

#### ✅ **Auto-Refresh Allowed When:**
- **Next Day + Progress**: Different day AND user completed 1+ questions
- **All Completed**: User finished all 5 questions (immediate refresh)
- **Manual Override**: Batch marked as stale (admin control)

#### ❌ **Auto-Refresh NOT Allowed When:**
- **Same Day**: User working on current batch (keeps questions stable)
- **No Progress**: Next day but user hasn't completed any questions
- **Recent Refresh**: Within 1-hour cooldown period

## 🎨 **User Experience**

### **Daily Flow:**
1. **Morning**: User gets 5 fresh recommendations
2. **During Day**: Questions stay stable, completed ones move to bottom
3. **Progress Tracking**: Clear visual progress (2/5 completed)
4. **Manual Option**: "Get Fresh Questions" button for completed ones
5. **Next Day**: Auto-refresh if user made progress

### **Button Logic:**
- **"Get Fresh Questions"** (✨): Replaces only completed questions, keeps incomplete ones
- **"Full Refresh"** (🔄): Complete batch refresh (only when conditions met)

## 🛠 **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend Changes:**

#### **1. Updated `shouldRefresh()` Method:**
```javascript
// NEW HYBRID LOGIC:
// 1. Same day: Only refresh if ALL completed
// 2. Next day: Refresh if user made ANY progress (completed 1+ questions)
// 3. Manual refresh always allowed (via isStale flag)
// 4. Respect cooldown period

const conditions = {
    nextDayWithProgress: isDifferentDay && this.questionsCompleted.length > 0,
    allCompleted: this.questionsCompleted.length >= this.recommendations.length,
    isStale: this.isStale,
    recentRefresh: timeSinceLastRefresh < (60 * 60 * 1000)
};

const shouldRefresh = (
    conditions.nextDayWithProgress ||
    conditions.allCompleted ||
    conditions.isStale
) && !conditions.recentRefresh;
```

#### **2. New `performSelectiveRefresh()` Function:**
- Keeps incomplete questions unchanged
- Replaces only completed questions with fresh ones
- Maintains user's current workflow

#### **3. New API Endpoint:**
```
POST /api/v1/smart-recommendations/:userId/replace-completed
```

### **Frontend Changes:**

#### **1. Enhanced Progress Display:**
- Shows completion status for each question
- Separates active vs completed questions
- Visual indicators (strikethrough, opacity, checkmarks)

#### **2. Smart Button Logic:**
- **"Get Fresh Questions"**: Shows when user has completed questions
- **"Full Refresh"**: Shows when system allows full refresh
- Different styling to indicate purpose

#### **3. Completed Questions Section:**
- Completed questions appear at bottom
- Clearly separated with divider
- Maintains reference for user

## 📊 **Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Fresh User (Morning)**
- **Condition**: No batch exists
- **Action**: Create fresh daily batch with 5 questions
- **User Sees**: 5 new recommendations, no refresh buttons

### **Scenario 2: User Completes 2 Questions (Same Day)**
- **Condition**: 2/5 completed, same day
- **Action**: No auto-refresh, show completed at bottom
- **User Sees**: 3 active + 2 completed, "Get Fresh Questions" button

### **Scenario 3: Next Day with Progress**
- **Condition**: User completed 2+ questions yesterday
- **Action**: Auto-refresh with smart carryover
- **User Sees**: Fresh batch based on updated progress

### **Scenario 4: Next Day without Progress**
- **Condition**: User didn't complete any questions yesterday
- **Action**: Keep same batch (no auto-refresh)
- **User Sees**: Same 5 questions from yesterday

### **Scenario 5: All Questions Completed**
- **Condition**: 5/5 completed
- **Action**: Immediate refresh allowed
- **User Sees**: Option for full refresh or fresh questions

## 🎯 **Benefits**

### **For Users:**
- ✅ **Stable Experience** - Questions don't disappear unexpectedly
- ✅ **Progress Tracking** - Clear view of what's completed
- ✅ **Manual Control** - Get fresh questions when ready
- ✅ **Reference** - Completed questions stay visible

### **For System:**
- ✅ **Smart Caching** - Reduces unnecessary API calls
- ✅ **Progress-Based** - Refreshes only when user is active
- ✅ **Flexible** - Handles different user patterns
- ✅ **Efficient** - Preserves relevant recommendations

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### **Timing Settings:**
- **Cooldown Period**: 1 hour between refreshes
- **Day Boundary**: Based on date string comparison
- **Progress Threshold**: 1+ completed questions for next-day refresh

### **Feature Flags:**
- **Selective Refresh**: Enabled by default
- **Auto-Refresh**: Based on hybrid conditions
- **Manual Override**: Always available via `isStale` flag

## 📈 **Monitoring**

### **Key Metrics:**
- **Refresh Rate**: How often users trigger refreshes
- **Completion Rate**: Questions completed per batch
- **User Satisfaction**: Based on completion patterns
- **System Performance**: API call reduction

### **Batch Metadata:**
- **Refresh Count**: Number of refreshes performed
- **Questions Replaced**: How many questions changed
- **Strategy**: Type of refresh (selective, full, next-day)

## 🚀 **Future Enhancements**

1. **Smart Timing**: Learn user's active hours for better refresh timing
2. **Difficulty Adaptation**: Adjust difficulty based on completion patterns
3. **Topic Preferences**: Learn which topics user prefers
4. **Streak Tracking**: Maintain daily completion streaks
5. **Batch Analytics**: Detailed insights on recommendation effectiveness
